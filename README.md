# IK1203
This repository is ongoing coursework in the course ik1203 Networks and Communication.

right now we have the class that is called TCPClient, and works in a straight-forward manner:

    Open a TCP connection to a server at a given host address and port number.
    Send data to the server.
    Take the data that the server sends back in response, and return that as the result.
